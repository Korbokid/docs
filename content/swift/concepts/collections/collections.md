#Collectons

###Collections in Swift are data structures that store a group of values. They are used to organize data and make it easier to access and manipulate. Swift provides three primary collection types: arrays, sets, and dictionaries.

### Arrays:
Arrays are ordered collections of values. They can be used to store a list of items in a specific order. For example, you could use an array to store a list of names, a list of numbers, or a list of dates.

Syntax:
//Start by creating a new array and adding contents to it.
var games = ["Fallout 4", "Fallout 4", "Zelda TOK"]

//Arrays are ordered lists so you can access a certain item like this:

print(games[1])
//"Diablo IV"

###Sets:
Sets are unordered collections of unique values. This means that no two values in a set can be the same. Sets are often used to store a collection of items that need to be unique, such as a list of usernames or a list of product IDs, password, etc.

Syntax

//Initialize a set like this

var movies: Set = ["Back to the future", "Whiplash", "Monkeybone"]


###Dictionaries

Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations. This means that each item in a dictionary has a key and a value. The key is used to uniquely identify the item in the dictionary, and the value is the data that is associated with the key. Dictionaries are often used to store a collection of data that is associated with a unique identifier, such as a list of contacts or a list of product prices.

Syntax

var Music: [Metal: metallica] = [:]


Collections in Swift are implemented as generic collections. This means that they can be used to store any type of value, as long as the type is defined in the project. For example, you could create an array of strings, a set of integers, or a dictionary of dates.

Collections in Swift are mutable, which means that they can be changed after they are created. This means that you can add, remove, or change items in a collection at any time. However, it is also possible to create immutable collections, which cannot be changed after they are created. Immutable collections are often used when you need to ensure that the data in a collection cannot be changed.

Here are some of the common operations that can be performed on collections in Swift:

Adding items: You can add items to a collection using the append() method.
Removing items: You can remove items from a collection using the remove() method.
Iterating through a collection: You can iterate through a collection using a for-loop.
Searching a collection: You can search a collection for a specific item using the contains() method.
Sorting a collection: You can sort a collection using the sort() method.
Collections are a powerful tool for organizing and manipulating data in Swift. They are used in a wide variety of applications, including web development, mobile development, and data science.
